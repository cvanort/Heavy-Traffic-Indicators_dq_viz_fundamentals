Heavy Traffic Indicators (Dataquest Viz Fundamentals)

In this project, I try to predict whether time or weather can predict heavy traffic using data from westbound traffic on I-94 between Minneapolis and St. Paul between 2012 and 2018. A more detailed description is in the jupyter notebook.

This script was based on a Dataquest project: Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94.
